# pillar2-frontend

Front-end microservice for Pillar 2 project. Pillar 2 refers to the Global Minimum Tax being introduced by the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

The Pillar 2 Top-up Taxes will ensure that global Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) with a turnover of >â‚¬750m are
subject to a minimum Effective Tax Rate of 15%, i.e. a top-up tax for Medium to Large MNEs.

## Running with Service Manager

microservices, with:
```shell

```shell
sm2 --stop PILLAR2_ALL
```

## Bank Account Reputation (BARS)
This service calls the BARS service within MDTP to verify business bank accounts as part of the pillar 2 repayments
journey. We call [the verify business endpoint](https://github.com/hmrc/bank-account-reputation/blob/main/public/api/conf/1.0/docs/business/verify.md) to verify accounts, because this is an external service in Local,
Development and Staging we call directly call their stub. Information about handling BARS in different environments are
detailed below:
- Local, Development and Staging uses the [bank-account-reputation-stub](https://github.com/hmrc/bank-account-reputation-stub).
    Refer to [the stub README for test data usage](https://github.com/hmrc/bank-account-reputation-stub?tab=readme-ov-file#personal-account-test-data)
- QA environment, BARS is connected to their third parties test system. Any test data you use here will need to be
    aligned with the test data that the third party service holds
- Production calls the MDTP service
